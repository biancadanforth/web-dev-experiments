    <p>I implemented the 'recent site' and 'last 3 sites' (reduced from 10) filters used by the Lightbeam web extension for Firefox using Dexie and some fake data.</p>
    <p>See console logs for the results.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this experiment was to see how easy/helpful it is to use this client-side storage library compared to localforage, both of which simplify asynchronous storage (using indexedDB) for improved performance over what we initially used for storage, localStorage, which is synchronous.</p>
